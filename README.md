# UFOs
## Overview
The objective for this project was to create a filterable table from a JavaScript array to view UFO sightings. Users are able to filter based on five different criteria (date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO). Using JavaScript and HTML we created a visually appealing webpage using CSS styles with a filterable table of UFO sightings.

## Results
Upon completion, the result of the project was a visually appealing and user-friendly filterable table of UFO sightings. To apply the filters the users types in the information and hits enter. 
The following image is the webpage without any filters applied.

The final filter allows users to type in a shape of the UFO. Here the search was for “triangle”.

To clear the filters you can hit the UFO Sightings banner in the top right. 

### Summary
In summary, the webpage accurately displays the given data.js array as a table; however, it could be more user friendly with instructions on how to reset the webpage to display all the data once a filter has been applied. For example, to have filters applied, you need to input the data as it’s displayed in the table, which means all lowercase. To improve the functionality the filters should be altered to accept (or ignore) capital letters. Also, for a larger dataset (the current one only covers the first 13 days in January, 2010) it would be beneficial to be able to select a range of dates or multiple cities, states, countries, or shapes. Another suggestion to improve the website would be to add a button that would clear the filters, rather than having to click the UFO Sightings banner at the top.
